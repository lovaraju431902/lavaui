# Building World-Class Components for Lava UI

This guide outlines the core philosophy, design principles, and technical steps required to build and integrate "world-class" components into the Lava UI library. Our goal is to raise the industry bar—creating components that feel like they belong on the homepages of elite tech companies like Vercel, Linear, and Stripe.

## Part 1: Design Philosophy & "Raising the Bar"

To build components at this level, you must think outside the box and obsess over the details. A world-class component is not just functional; it is a premium, interactive experience.

### 1. Strict Monochrome Minimalism
- **Neutral Scale Only**: Strictly use the neutral color scale (`neutral-100` to `neutral-900`) and pure `white`/`black`. 
- **No Primary/Secondary Colors**: Avoid raw blues, reds, purples, or greens unless specifically required for semantic indicators (e.g., macOS traffic lights or standard success/error text).
- **Subtle Depth**: Use `shadow-sm`, 1px borders (`ring-1 ring-neutral-200 dark:ring-neutral-800`), and `backdrop-blur` to create depth instead of relying on colored backgrounds.

### 2. High-Fidelity Micro-Interactions (Framer Motion)
- **Fluid Physics**: Never use linear CSS transitions for complex animations. Always use `framer-motion` spring physics.
  ```typescript
  const SPRING_FLUID: Transition = { type: "spring", stiffness: 300, damping: 30 };
  const SPRING_TACTILE: Transition = { type: "spring", stiffness: 400, damping: 25, mass: 1 };
  ```
- **Staggered Animations**: Use `staggerChildren` to create cascading entrance or hover effects.
- **Continuous Motion**: Incorporate subtle infinite loops (like a gently glowing pulse or a floating element) to make the component feel "alive" even when not actively interacted with.

### 3. Think Outside the Box (Dynamic Realism)
Don't just build static UI representations. Build **miniature, working replicas** of real-world features.
- *Instead of a static Calendar Grid*: Build an interactive **Agenda View** with a glowing, sliding "Current Time" indicator.
- *Instead of an AI Chat Icon*: Build a **Dynamic Chat Interface** where a message slides in and the AI realistically "types" out a response block by block.
- *Instead of a File Icon*: Build a **Cloud Sync Visualizer** where tiny file SVGs get magnetically pulled into a central cloud node.

### 4. Perfect Layout & Responsive Balance
- **Padding is Breathing Room**: Ensure inner padding is responsive (`p-4 sm:p-5 xl:p-6`) so content never overflows or suffocates on smaller viewports.
- **Fluid Bounds**: Use flexible limits (e.g., `w-full max-w-[200px] xl:max-w-[240px]`) so components cleanly scale down and maintain proportion without breaking grid columns.
- **Asymmetrical Balance**: When building layouts like Bento Grids, avoid repetitive column spans (e.g., don't do `1|2|1` on every row). Alternate row spans (e.g., `2|1|1` → `1|1|2` → `1|2|1`) to create dynamic masonry flows.

## Part 2: Technical Integration Workflow

Follow these exact steps when adding a new component to Lava UI.

### Step 1: Create the Component in the Registry
1. Place the core component code in `app/registry/[component-name]/`.
2. Ensure it is entirely self-contained, using `framer-motion` and `lucide-react` for icons.
3. If the component requires multiple smaller demos (like the Bento Grid cards), separate them into a `demo-cards.tsx` file for cleanliness.

### Step 2: Create the Documentation Page
1. Create a new route: `app/(docs)/docs/[component-name]/page.tsx`.
2. Use the `SEOWrapper` and standard metadata.
3. Use the `PreviewCodeCard` to wrap your demo. 
   - **CRITICAL RULE**: The interactive demo must *only* render inside the `Preview` tab of the `PreviewCodeCard`. It should *never* bleed into the `Code`, `CLI`, or `Installation` tabs.
   ```tsx
   <PreviewCodeCard
     path="app/registry/[component-name]/[component-name].tsx"
     title="[Component Name]"
     description="A premium [Component Name] component."
   >
     <YourComponentDemo />
   </PreviewCodeCard>
   ```

### Step 3: Register the Component for the CLI (Optional but Recommended)
If the component is meant to be installable via a CLI tool:
1. Update your registry `.json` files or mapping scripts to expose the raw file contents so users can copy/paste or execute an install command.

### Step 4: Add to Sidebar Navigation
1. Open `app/(docs)/layout-parts/documentation.constant.ts`.
2. Locate the appropriate category (e.g., "Components", "Layout", or "Animations").
3. Add the component to the `items` array:
   ```typescript
   {
     title: "Component Name",
     url: "/docs/component-name",
     label: "New", // Add 'New' label for fresh components
   }
   ```

### Step 5: Update the Global Routes Config
1. Open `lib/routes-config.ts`.
2. Find the relevant `ROUTES` array block (e.g., `href: "/docs/components"`).
3. Add the route object:
   ```typescript
   { title: "Component Name", href: "/component-name" }
   ```
4. This ensures the component is fully searchable and the "Next/Previous" pagination at the bottom of docs pages correctly wires up to the new component.

By adhering to these strict aesthetics and workflow processes, you ensure that every addition to Lava UI maintains a flawless, world-class standard.
